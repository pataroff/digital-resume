      <h2>Pre-Development</h2>
      <p>
        'Innotopia' is the new brand identity name of
        <a
          style="text-decoration: underline"
          href="https://indietopia.org"
          target="_blank"
          >'Indietopia'</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout the years, 'Indietopia' shifted its activities from hosting
        an accelerator program towards creating interactive experiences and
        gamified solutions for businesses and cultural institutions. To support
        these changes, the team of 'Indietopia' thought it was a good time for a
        new identity and a new website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, after I did my internship at the company and hearing the
        plans about the rebrand, I proposed to them to do their new website.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had been learning web development for more than half a year by then
        and I thought this would be a good opportunity to build a project on my
        own and see where I stand.
      </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        Before I started with the development, I decided to first create the
        design for the website. I figured out that having a reference would make
        it easier to code the layout instead of designing it on the spot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, I wanted to first get approval on the design from
        'Indietopia' before starting to write any code, as it would be much
        easier to make changes in the design phase than in the development
        phase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, I made a quick sketch of my design idea to pitch it to the
        'Indietopia' team.
      </p>

      <h3>Innotopia Website v1:</h3>
      <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
      <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v1.png"
          alt="Innotopia Website v1"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        After pitching my idea, the 'Indietopia' team approved it, and it seemed
        like we were all on the same page.
      </p>

      <p>
        With their feedback and input, I refined the design further by iterating
        on it until it aligned with their vision and objectives.
      </p>

      <p>
        This collaborative process not only strengthened the design but also
        fostered a sense of shared ownership of the project.
      </p>

      <h3>Innotopia Website v2:</h3>
      <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
      <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v2.png"
          alt="Innotopia Website v2"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        In this first iteration, I was trying to add some color to the original
        design as some of the team members found it to be too blank.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project manager suggested 'lime green' and I decided to experiment
        with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, it didn't look very well as the primary color, but I decided
        to still keep it as a possible accent color in order to adhere to the
        design requirements of the client.
      </p>

      <h3>Innotopia Website v3:</h3>
      <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
      <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v3.png"
          alt="Innotopia Website v3"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        In this second iteration, I was still trying to find the 'right color'
        for the design of the website while also making some adjustments to the
        different sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were suggestions for 'purple' and different shades of it, but in
        the end we concluded that the color is overused on the web nowadays and
        decided to drop it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionaly, I thought it would be a good idea to have a 'hero' image
        that represents the brand identity of 'Indietopia'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering the fact that 'Indietopia' is based in Groningen and most of
        their business partnerships are with other local comapnies, I thought it
        would be fitting to include something that represent the Groningen area.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          style="text-decoration: underline"
          href="https://www.artstation.com/brentkeuning"
          target="_blank"
          >Brent Keuning</a
        >
        came up with this 'hexagonal tile' that includes 2 of the most popular
        buildings in the Groningen area -
        <i>'Martini Tower'</i> and <i>'Forum Groningen'</i>.
      </p>

      <h3>Innotopia Website v4:</h3>
      <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
      <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v4.png"
          alt="Innotopia Website v4"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        In this third iteration, I finally settled on a 'dark blue' as the
        primary color for the website and finalized the layout of the different
        sections.
      </p>

      <p>
        This iteration resonated most strongly with the 'Indietopia' team. The
        choice of 'dark blue' and the refined layout perfectly captured the
        essence of their brand, evoking a sense of professionalism and
        trustworthiness that aligned well with their goals and vision.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this point onward, the design remained mostly unchanged, with only
        minor adjustments to the colors.
      </p>

      <p>
        The initial design requirement for 'lime green' was met by using it as
        an accent color in the final version of the design.
      </p>

      <h3>Innotopia Website (Final):</h3>
      <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
      <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
        <img
          src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_final.png"
          alt="Innotopia Website (Final)"
        />
      </div>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <!-- Innotopia Website 3D Model -->
