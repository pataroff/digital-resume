        <h2>Pre-Development</h2>
        <p>
          'Innotopia' is the new brand identity name of
          <a
            style="text-decoration: underline"
            href="https://indietopia.org"
            target="_blank"
            >'Indietopia'</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout the years, 'Indietopia' shifted its activities from hosting
          an accelerator program towards creating interactive experiences and
          gamified solutions for businesses and cultural institutions. To
          support these changes, the 'Indietopia' team believed it was the right
          time for a new identity and a new website.
        </p>

        <p>
          After completing my internship at the company and learning about their
          rebranding plans, I proposed to them create the new website.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had been studying web development for over half a year by then, and
          I saw this as a great opportunity to take on a project on my own and
          assess my skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          Before diving into development, I chose to first create the website's
          design. I realized that having clear design guidelines to stick to
          would help me streamline the coding process of the layout and allow me
          to work more efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, I wanted to first get approval on the design from
          'Indietopia' before commencing any coding, as this approach allows for
          more convenient changes during the design phase, as opposed to the
          more rigid development phase.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, I made a quick sketch of my design idea to present it to
          the 'Indietopia' team.
        </p>

        <h3>Innotopia Website (Concept):</h3>
        <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
        <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_concept.png"
            alt="Innotopia Website (Concept)"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          After presenting my concept, the 'Indietopia' team gave their
          approval, and it appeared that we were alligned in our vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          Taking their valuable feedback and insights into account, I embarked
          on the journey of refining the design. This entailed multiple
          iterations, each one drawing us closer to a design that truly
          encapsulated their objectives and vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          This collaborative process not only strengthened the design but also
          fostered a sense of shared ownership of the project. It was a journey
          we all embarked on together, and the end result reflected our combined
          commitment to excellence.
        </p>

        <h3>Innotopia Website v1:</h3>
        <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
        <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v1.png"
            alt="Innotopia Website v1"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          In the first iteration, I attempted to introduce color to the initial
          design, addressing feedback from team members who found it too plain
        </p>

        <p>
          The project manager suggested 'lime green,' and I decided to
          experiment with it while simultaneously making adjustments to various
          sections of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, it didn't look so well as the primary color, but I decided
          to still keep it as a possible accent color in order to adhere to the
          design requirements of the client.
        </p>

        <h3>Innotopia Website v2:</h3>
        <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
        <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v2.png"
            alt="Innotopia Website v2"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          In the second iteration, I continued my search for the 'right color'
          for the website's design while making further adjustments to the
          different sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were suggestions for 'purple' and different shades of it, but in
          the end we concluded that the color is overused on the web nowadays
          and decided to drop it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I thought it would be a good idea to have a 'hero' image
          that represents the brand identity of 'Indietopia'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering the fact that 'Indietopia' is based in Groningen and most
          of their business partnerships are with other local comapnies, I
          thought it would be fitting to include something that represent the
          Groningen area.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bring this vision to life,
          <a
            style="text-decoration: underline"
            href="https://www.artstation.com/brentkeuning"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Brent Keuning</a
          >
          designed a 'hexagonal tile' showcasing two of Groningen's most iconic
          landmarks - the
          <i>'Martini Tower'</i> and <i>'Forum Groningen'</i>.
        </p>

        <h3>Innotopia Website v3:</h3>
        <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
        <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v3.png"
            alt="Innotopia Website v3"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          In this third iteration, I finally settled on 'dark blue' as the
          primary color for the website and finalized the layout of the
          different sections.
        </p>

        <p>
          This iteration resonated most strongly with the 'Indietopia' team. The
          choice of 'dark blue' and the refined layout perfectly captured the
          essence of their brand, evoking a sense of professionalism and
          trustworthiness that aligned well with their goals and vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          From this point onward, the design remained mostly unchanged, with
          only minor adjustments to the colors and some small elements from the
          different sections.
        </p>

        <p>
          The initial design requirement for 'lime green' was met by using it as
          an accent color in the final version of the design.
        </p>
