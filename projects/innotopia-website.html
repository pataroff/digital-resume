        <h2>Pre-Development</h2>
        <p>
          'Innotopia' is the new brand identity name of
          <a
            style="text-decoration: underline"
            href="https://indietopia.org"
            target="_blank"
            >'Indietopia'</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout the years, 'Indietopia' shifted its activities from hosting
          an accelerator program towards creating interactive experiences and
          gamified solutions for businesses and cultural institutions. To
          support these changes, the 'Indietopia' team believed it was the right
          time for a new identity and a new website.
        </p>

        <p>
          After completing my internship at the company and learning about their
          rebranding plans, I proposed to them to create the new website.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had been studying web development for over half a year by then, and
          I saw this as a great opportunity to take on a project on my own and
          assess my skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          Before diving into development, I chose to first create the website's
          design. I realized that having clear design guidelines to stick to
          would help me streamline the coding process of the layout and allow me
          to work more efficiently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally, I wanted to first get approval on the design from
          'Indietopia' before commencing any coding, as this approach allows for
          more convenient changes during the design phase, as opposed to the
          more rigid development phase.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, I made a quick sketch of my design idea to present it to
          the 'Indietopia' team.
        </p>

        <h3>Innotopia Website (Concept):</h3>
        <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
        <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_concept.png"
            alt="Innotopia Website (Concept)"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          After presenting my concept, the 'Innotopia' team gave their approval,
          and it appeared that we were alligned in our vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          Taking their valuable feedback and insights into account, I embarked
          on the journey of refining the design. This entailed multiple
          iterations, each one drawing us closer to a design that truly
          encapsulated their objectives and vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          This collaborative process not only strengthened the design but also
          fostered a sense of shared ownership of the project. It was a journey
          we all embarked on together, and the end result reflected our combined
          commitment to excellence.
        </p>

        <h3>Innotopia Website v1:</h3>
        <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
        <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v1.png"
            alt="Innotopia Website v1"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          In the first iteration, I attempted to introduce color to the initial
          design, addressing feedback from team members who found it too plain
        </p>

        <p>
          The project manager suggested 'lime green,' and I decided to
          experiment with it while simultaneously making adjustments to various
          sections of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, it didn't look so well as the primary color, but I decided
          to still keep it as a possible accent color in order to adhere to the
          design requirements of the client.
        </p>

        <h3>Innotopia Website v2:</h3>
        <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
        <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v2.png"
            alt="Innotopia Website v2"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          In the second iteration, I continued my search for the 'right color'
          for the website's design while making further adjustments to the
          different sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were suggestions for 'purple' and different shades of it, but in
          the end we concluded that the color is overused on the web nowadays
          and decided to drop it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I thought it would be a good idea to have a 'hero' image
          that represents the brand identity of 'Innotopia'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering the fact that 'Innotopia' is based in Groningen and most
          of their business partnerships are with other local comapnies, I
          thought it would be fitting to include something that represent the
          Groningen area.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bring this vision to life,
          <a
            style="text-decoration: underline"
            href="https://www.artstation.com/brentkeuning"
            target="_blank"
          >
            Brent Keuning</a
          >
          designed a 'hexagonal tile' showcasing two of Groningen's most iconic
          landmarks - the
          <i>'Martini Tower'</i> and <i>'Forum Groningen'</i>.
        </p>

        <h3>Innotopia Website v3:</h3>
        <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
        <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_v3.png"
            alt="Innotopia Website v3"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          In this third iteration, I finally settled on 'dark blue' as the
          primary color for the website and finalized the layout of the
          different sections.
        </p>

        <p>
          This iteration resonated most strongly with the 'Innotopia' team. The
          choice of 'dark blue' and the refined layout perfectly captured the
          essence of their brand, evoking a sense of professionalism and
          trustworthiness that aligned well with their goals and vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          From this point onward, the design remained mostly unchanged, with
          only minor adjustments to the colors and some small elements from the
          different sections.
        </p>

        <p>
          The initial design requirement for 'lime green' was met by using it as
          an accent color in the final version of the design.
        </p>

        <h3>Innotopia Website (Final):</h3>
        <p>Hover over the image and scroll down.</p>
        <div style="overflow-y: scroll; max-height: 450px">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/innotopia_website_final.png"
            alt="Innotopia Website (Final)"
          />
        </div>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
          With the design concept firmly established and refined, the project
          was now ready to transition from the design phase to the development
          phase, where the website's functionality and interactivity would come
          to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, it became evident that certain design requirements,
          especially in the technical realm, needed further discussion with the
          client. The client expressed a desire for full customizability of the
          website and its content, which led to the proposal of implementing a
          content management system (CMS).
        </p>

        <h3>Sanity Studio</h3>
        <img
          src="/assets/images/innotopia_sanity_studio.png"
          alt="Sanity Studio"
        />

        <p>
          I carefully considered the client's request for full customizability
          and opted for
          <a
            style="text-decoration: underline"
            href="https://www.sanity.io/"
            target="_blank"
            >'Sanity CMS'</a
          >
          as the solution of choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          With Sanity CMS, I could guarantee that every aspect of the website's
          content, from text and images to dynamic elements and data-driven
          components, could be fully customized and managed seamlessly through
          the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          This ensured that the client had the flexibility and control needed to
          make real-time updates and tailor the website's content to their exact
          specifications and needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Sanity CMS Demo</h3>
        <p>
          Click the 'Play' button to start the video, and then switch to
          full-screen mode.
        </p>
        <video controls>
          <source
            src="/assets/videos/innotopia_sanity_demo.mp4"
            type="video/mp4"
          />
          Your browser does not support the video format.
        </video>

        <h3>Shopstory</h3>
        <img
          src="/assets/images/innotopia_shopstory.png"
          alt="Shopstory Plugin"
        />
        <p>
          However, the client's vision went beyond content customization, as
          'Innotopia' also expressed the need for extensive control over the
          layout and design of the website.
        </p>

        <p>
          While 'Sanity CMS' excelled in content management, it focuses
          primarily on the text, images, dynamic elements, and data-driven
          components.
        </p>

        <p>
          To fulfill the client's comprehensive customization requirements, I
          decided to complement 'Sanity CMS' with the
          <a
            style="text-decoration: underline"
            href="https://www.shopstory.app/"
            target="_blank"
            >'Shopstory'</a
          >
          plugin, a visual page builder designed for seamless layout and design
          alterations.
        </p>

        <p>
          'Shopstory' allowed the client to have creative control over the
          website's structure, making it an ideal choice for meeting their
          content and layout customization needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          This strategic combination of 'Sanity CMS' with 'Shopstory' ensured
          that the client had the freedom and flexibility to tailor both content
          and layout to their exact specifications, all within a single,
          user-friendly system.
        </p>

        <h3>Shopstory Demo</h3>
        <p>
          Click the 'Play' button to start the video, and then switch to
          full-screen mode.

          <source

        <h3>React Three Fiber</h3>
        <img
          src="/assets//images/innotopia_website_3dmodel.gif"
          alt="React Three Fiber"
        />

        <p>
          As the project progressed from the conceptual phase to its
          realization, it became apparent that we had an exciting opportunity to
          further align the website with Innotopia's brand identity.
        </p>

        <p>
          This further alignment took shape in the form of a captivating 3D
          model, an evolution of the original 'hexagonal' tile created by
          <a
            style="text-decoration: underline"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.artstation.com/brentkeuning"
            >Brent Keuning</a
          >
          earlier during the design phase.
        </p>

        <p>
          To breathe life into the 3D model and enable user interaction, I
          harnessed the capabilities of
          <a
            style="text-decoration: underline"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction"
            >'React Three Fiber'</a
          >, a React renderer for
          <a
            style="text-decoration: underline"
            href="https://threejs.org/"
            target="_blank"
            >'three.js'</a
          >
          - a JavaScript 3D Library.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 3D model became a centerpiece of the website, providing visitors
          with an interactive and immersive experience that resonated with
          Innotopia's brand identity and commitment to innovation and
          playfulness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Its introduction marked the completion of a project that now stood as
          a true reflection of Innotopia's brand identity and a testament to my
          dedication to delivering a unique online presence, fully aligned with
          the client's vision and requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>Post-Development</h2>
        <p>
          Reflecting on the project as a whole, it has been an invaluable
          learning experience and a true test of my web development skills. The
          journey from design to development encapsulated the entire product
          design cycle, allowing me to fully grasp the interplay between
          creative vision and technical execution.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I'm proud of the results I achieved, I also recognize that, like
          any creative endeavor, there are aspects that could have been refined
          or executed more effectively. This awareness, however, is what makes
          each project a unique opportunity for growth, as I continue to refine
          my skills and approaches.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, this project represents a crucial milestone in my web
          development journey, and I'm enthusiastic about the ongoing
          responsibility of maintaining and regularly updating the website. It's
          a dynamic canvas that will evolve with the ever-changing landscape of
          web development, and I look forward to the journey ahead as we enhance
          and expand its features in line with Innotopia's vision.
